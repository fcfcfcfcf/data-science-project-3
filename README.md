# data-science-project-3

The goal of this projects is to introduce concepts in clustering. 

I use Affinity Propogation clustering to find similar groups of films using over 1 million tag applications from the ml-latest movie dataset from GroupLens (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). The datasets are too large to store in this repo, so you will have to download them yourself if you want to run this on your own machine.
